\title{A wrapper function to download and compile data from the Peruvian National Hydrological and Meterological Service}
\usage{
senamhiR(tasks, station, automatic = TRUE, dataAvail = TRUE,
  fallback = NULL, type = "z", config = "z", startYear, endYear,
  startMonth = 1, endMonth = 12, writeMode = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tasks}{numerical; define which tasks to perform: 1) Download Data, 2) Compile CSV of Downloaded Data, 3) Both.}

\item{station}{character; the number of the station id number to process. Can also be a vector of station ids.}

\item{automatic}{logical; if set to true (default), the script will attempt to guess the type and config values as well as startYear and endYear}

\item{dataAvail}{logical; if set to true (default), the script will either automatically attempt to choose start and end datas, or return a(n outdated) table of the data available for your station.}

\item{fallback}{vector; if dataAvail is used, this vector will provide a fallback start and end year to download if the auto find fails.}

\item{type}{character; defines if the station is (CON)ventional, DAV, (SUT)ron, or (SIA)p. Must be "CON", "DAV", "SUT" or "SIA".}

\item{config}{character; defines if the station is (M)eterological (2) or (H)ydrological. Must be "M", "M1", "M2" or "H".}

\item{startYear}{numerical; the first year to process.}

\item{endYear}{numerical; the last year to process.}

\item{startMonth}{numerical; the first month to process. Defaults to 1.}

\item{endMonth}{numerical; the last month to process. Defaults to 12.}

\item{writeMode}{character; if set to 'append', the script will append the data to an exisiting file; if set to 'overwrite', it will overwrite an existing file. If not set, it will not overwrite.}
